# RLDM25 extended abstract

This repository contains the data and code for the work presented at the Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making 2025 (RLDM25) conference.

In addition, I have created an extension to create a .pdf document using the [style guidelines](https://rldm.org/call-for-abstracts-2025/) provided by the organisation of RLDM25. It is not for general use, but with some tweaks it might work for other
